This site is meant to serve two purposes. On one hand, it is a project site where I can test new ideas and play with front-end concepts. On the other hand, it is a place to showcase my development work in a way that is a little more interesting, interactive, and relevant than the single-page CV.


###jQuery 
The only jQuery plugin used on this site is "Cowboy" Ben Alman's [throttle/debounce plugin][1] The rest, in the spirit of learning how these common plugins work and why they are awesome, were coded by hand:

* smooth scrolling
* highlight current section in navbar 
* modal navigation popup on smaller devices
* video start/stop on hover (or click on smaller devices)

###Sass/Compass

* stylesheet organization
* css minification
* mixins / media queries
* sassy buttons

###Sketch 

* I designed all logos and svg images using Sketch 3. 

###Dependencies -

* Google Fonts
* Font-awesome icons
* sassy buttons
